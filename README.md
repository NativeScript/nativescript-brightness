[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NativeScript/nativescript-brightness.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NativeScript/nativescript-brightness)
[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/nativescript-brightness.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-brightness)

A plugin for manipulating your device's screeen brightness in NativeScript Android and iOS apps.

## Installation

Run the following command from the root of your project:

```
tns plugin add nativescript-brightness
```

This command automatically installs the necessary files, as well as stores nativescript-brightness as a dependency in your project's `package.json` file.

This plugin requires `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS"/>` to be added in the android manifest.


## Usage 

To use the brightness module you must first `require()` and instantiate it:

```js
// JavaScript
var nativescriptBrightness = require("nativescript-brightness");
var brightness = new nativescriptBrightness.Brightness();
```

Or if youâ€™re using TypeScript, `import` the module:

```typescript
// TypeScript
import { Brightness } from 'nativescript-brightness';
const brightness = new Brightness();
```

After you have a reference to the module you can then call its `get()` and `set()` methods. For example, the code below updates you screen's brightness with an `intensity` setting of 25%.

The `intensity` can be set to a value from 1 to 100.

```js
// TypeScript
import { Brightness } from 'nativescript-brightness';
const brightness = new Brightness();

brightness.set({
    intensity: 25
});
```
